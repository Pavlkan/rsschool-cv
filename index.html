            <h2>Briefly About Myself</h2>
            <p>I am 24 years old and work as a pharmacist. One of the aspects of working in hospital's pharmacy is high level of interaction with computers and old software. That's how I started being interested in programming and seeking the ways to use the skills in my work. As for my personal values, I am a good team worker, I always try to do my best to delve into task, to optimize it and deepen my knowledge. That's the reason I am here - to gain theoretical base and practical skills in frontend development.</p>
